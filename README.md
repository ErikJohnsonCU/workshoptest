# workshoptest
A test of a workshop concept for teaching Git

# Step 1: Adding a line with your name (maybe we should have everyone create a fork first...)
## Create a branch
`git branch <your-name-here>`
## Switch to your new branch
`git checkout <your-name-here>`
## Make your changes
Open the `index.html` file and add a line with your name and message
## Add your changes
`git add index.html`
## Commit your changes
`git commit -m "My descriptive commit message"`
## Push your changes to your branch
`git push origin <your-name-here>`

# Step 2: Requesting that the project administrator use your code in the project (Pull Request)
Kind of an important thing to know how to do...
